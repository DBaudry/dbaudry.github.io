In July 2025, I became a permanent researcher at Inria and Université Grenoble-Alpes in the [Ghost team](https://ghost-team.gitlabpages.inria.fr/). Research topics within our team are at the interface of game theory, optimization, machine learning and stochastic dynamical systems. 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, working with [Patrick Rebeschini](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rebeschi/) on online learning and optimization. 

Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Inria Fairplay team, based at ENSAE Paris, collaborating with [Vianney Perchet](https://vianney.ai/). My work focused on online algorithms and bandit models, particularly in structured and constrained problem settings, with practical applications in online advertising and recommendation systems.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Lille, where I worked under the direction of [Emilie Kaufmann](http://chercheurs.lille.inria.fr/ekaufman/) and [Odalric-Ambrym Maillard](http://odalricambrymmaillard.neowordpress.fr/) in the INRIA ScooL team. My PhD research focused on non-parametric algorithms for the Multi-Armed Bandit problem, motivated by an application in agriculture. I explored several approaches based on sub-sampling or bootstrapping, designed to work under non-parametric assumptions on the reward distributions. I then extended these works to address practical considerations, such as risk-aware learning or non-stationarity of rewards. During my PhD, I also had the privilege to visit Pr. [Junya Honda](http://stat.sys.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/honda/index_e.html) at the University of Kyoto for 3 months, where I further explored the connection between different families of bandit algorithms.
